# Builds understory and installs it to ~/.local/bin (or
# $UNDERSTORY_INSTALL_DIR), then code-signs it with a stable local
# certificate + identifier instead of leaving it plain ad-hoc-signed.
#
# Why this matters: every unsigned Go binary macOS ad-hoc-signs at link
# time carries the same generic identifier ("a.out"), with the signature
# itself keyed to that exact binary's content hash (cdhash). Rebuilding
# changes the hash, so macOS treats the new binary as a brand-new,
# never-before-seen app and drops any Accessibility/Automation
# permission already granted to the old one. understory needs both (for
# mycelium's window-detection AppleScript, backing Enter's open-or-reuse
# behavior) on every run, so without a stable signature it'd need
# re-approving after every single rebuild.
#
# Signing with a real certificate (self-signed is fine for local dev)
# anchors the permission to that certificate + a fixed --identifier
# instead of the binary's hash, so the grant survives rebuilds as long
# as the same cert + identifier are reused. This script assumes that
# certificate already exists in your login keychain (create one once,
# e.g. via openssl + `security import`/`add-trusted-cert`, named
# whatever UNDERSTORY_CODESIGN_CERT below expects) — if it can't find
# one, it still installs, just without a stable signature, and warns
# that Accessibility/Automation will need re-granting after the next
# rebuild.
